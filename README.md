# Prodo
Prodo - an eCommerce App using Angular 2, ASP.NET Web API V2, Node.js, TypeScript, Bootstrap 4, etc.

Prodo uses ASP.NET Web API V2 for REST services and Angular 2 for front-end application. To watch the video tutorials for this project, [please visit my Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6KFB-5xV5TpS_X0lS2DeeRkgON31Uz8S).

I've used Visual Studio 2015 for the projects. You can use any IDE or code-editor for Angular 2 application but you will need to use Visual Studio to open the
Web API project.

I'm also using a Node Task Runner Explorer extension in Visual Studio. This makes running and visualising all the npm commands really easy.
You may get this extension for VS [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MadsKristensen.TaskRunnerExplorer). 

To run this application, follow the steps below:

 - run `npm install`
 - run `npm start`

Prodo uses in-memory persistence for data. I may convert this to use Entity Framework and SQL Server OR NoSQL later.
